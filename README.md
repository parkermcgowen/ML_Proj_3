Upload df folder into colab and should run right out the box.

I've been having issues with colab today, so if this isn't resolved in the future do this instead:

1) create a folder named 'df' in colab.
2) create 2 folders within that folder labeled '0' and '1'
3) select all files from their respective folder and drag onto the correct label.
